# odin-recipe
In this project I aim to create a recipe website where 
I will display my knowledge on how to link pages together
in a coherent manner, use images and external resources effectively whilst
managing an organized file system.

Edit: So I did not commit as often as I should have but that is something that I will improve on the next project.
