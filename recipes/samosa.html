    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, onion, and
        <br />
        garlic; cook until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce
        heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in coriander, cumin, salt, turmeric, chile powder, and ginger. Add
        peas and water <br />; bring to boil. Cover and simmer, stirring
        occasionally, about 25 minutes. Uncover and cook <br />
        over medium heat, stirring frequently, until any remaining liquid
        evaporates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir jalapenos and garam masala into the beef mixture. Remove from heat
        and stir in lemon juice; <br />
        let cool until safe to handle, at least 15 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Drop about 1 tablespoon of the beef mixture onto the center of a wonton
        wrapper. Moisten edges with <br />
        water, fold them over the filling, and seal. Repeat with remaining
        filling and wonton wrappers
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat about 1/2 inch oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add
        samosas in batches; fry <br />
        until browned, 1 to 2 inches per side.
      </li>
    </ol>
